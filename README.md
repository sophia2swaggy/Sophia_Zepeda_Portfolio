## 📊 Data & Analytics Projects

### 🔍 Project: Boston Home Price Analysis  
**Tech:** R / Jupyter Notebook, Linear Regression  
**Summary:**  
In this project, I implemented a multi-layer neural network in PyTorch to predict a binary outcome from seven numeric features.  
I handled data preprocessing (scaling, train/validation/test split), defined a 3-hidden-layer architecture (11,051 parameters), 
trained the model with mini-batch gradient descent, and evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, 
and a classification report on a held-out test set.
